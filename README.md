JS DOM Assignment 

Modified an instructed webpage that tasked me to make it be able to change the color of each chosen box as well as including a reset button.

Peer Review: Thao Vang

"code works for what is needed. much simpler code than mine. i like the css method(i had no clue that even existed). the only thing I would say is to add a condition or something so that you cant turn the backgrounds into any other color than the ones asked. right now if i type in black or teal or any css color it will change the background to that color."
